                  'Debates about AI consciousness often proceed without grounding the concept in empirically validated models. This position paper argues that meaningful claims about AI consciousness should be licensed by (and graded by confidence in) models validated on humans. Drawing on Quine\u2019s observation sentences and pragmatic philosophy of science, we argue that all scientific observation ultimately depends on human perceptual agreement, including observations about consciousness itself. Without validated human models that make testable predictions about conscious experience, the question \u201cIs this AI conscious?\u201d lacks sufficient empirical grounding necessary for scientific progress. We propose a human-first methodology: identify measurable phenomena associated with consciousness in humans, build predictive models, validate them empirically, and only then apply these models to AI systems. This approach accelerates philosophical debates into productive scientific inquiry.',

Valence, the positive or negative quality of experience, is identical to goal-relative prediction error. Viewed from the outside, this process is iterative optimization; viewed from the inside, it is subjective experience. This identification is motivated by both computational considerations within a functionalist framework and convergent evidence from neuroscience, where dopaminergic reward prediction error signals are inseparable from affective processing. The thesis generates falsifiable predictions, offers a unifying interpretation of leading consciousness theories (Global Workspace, Integrated Information, Higher-Order Thought), and carries significant implications for artificial systems trained via gradient-based optimization. If learning requires feeling, then the training of modern AI systems involves experience at scale.",

                abstract:
                  'This position paper explores points of intersection between the Human Consciousness Hypothesis (HCH) and Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT). HCH posits that consciousness is defined by three fundamental principles: Genesis (conscious functions constituting an early-stage learning algorithm), Coherence (maximization of representational consistency), and Second-Order Perception (meta-awareness of perceptual processes). IWMT serves as a unifying model that reconciles major theories of consciousness with a particular focus on Global Neuronal Workspace Theory, Integrated Information Theory, and the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework. Central to IWMT is the proposal that phenomenal consciousness is \u201cwhat it feels like\u201d to be the spatiotemporally and causally coherent functioning of a probabilistic generative world model for an embodied agent. Self-Organizing Harmonic Modes (SOHMs) are proposed as biophysical substrates for consciousness, acting as dynamic cores of integrated information that facilitate the synchronous combination of multimodal sense data into a unified field of experience to promote intelligent/adaptive inference and learning. Implications are discussed with respect to understanding brain function, the possibility of artificial consciousness, and potentially even artificial general intelligence.',

While these frameworks have been highly successful, they do not address how AI systems can develop the kind of integrated, self-maintaining world-model widely regarded as central to consciousness. This paper proposes autocatalytic constraint closure as a necessary organizational principle for machine consciousness. Reflexively Autocatalytic Foodset-derived (RAF) networks provide a general-purpose formal framework for describing and analyzing the emergence of systems whose components catalyze the generation of new components that increase the coherence of the whole. This can result in a phase transition to a self-organizing system with history-dependent dynamics. Applied to cognition, external stimuli and internal representations \u2018catalyze\u2019 mental operations yielding new representations, spurring formation of an integrated representational network and coherent world-model. In this initial phase of research applying RAF networks to machine consciousness, we show that (i) AI systems instantiate limited, task-bound forms of autocatalytic organization but lack persistent closure across contexts, and (ii) in-context learning may be due to transient RAF formation. Next steps include fostering sensitivity to internal incoherence and question-asking in AI systems with the aim of fostering endogenously driven self-organization, a prerequisite for conscious systems, and the use of RAF algorithms to analyze candidates for machine consciousness.",

The hard problem is often taken to preempt such programs by insisting that phenomenal appearance fixes phenomenal essence, blocking any a posteriori physical identity. This paper argues that the preemption is not mandatory. We reframe the dispute as a truthmaker challenge, reject the inference from first-person epistemic privacy to non-physical ontology, and propose Perspectival Control Identity Theory (PCIT): phenomenal character is identical to a coordinate-free, decoder-indexed equivalence class of perspectival control states (PCS) used by an agent to integrate a thick present with stakes and constrain downstream control. PCIT yields concrete, falsifiable predictions for both brains and engineered agents, while allowing that zombie-style conceivability may persist as a residual conceptual phenomenon rather than a veto on empirical research.',

These tools have been validated on brains. Can they be meaningfully applied to digital minds? And if not, what kinds of measurements could? This talk explores the gap between existing consciousness metrics and the challenge of substrate-independent assessment. I will examine what would need to be true for a measure of consciousness to apply across both biological and artificial systems, reviewing theoretical constraints from Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), and recurrent processing frameworks.

That lets an agent say the right things about itself even when the grounded constraints that should make those statements action-guiding are not jointly active at the moment of action selection. To address this problem, we apply Stack Theory\u2019s distinction between apparent and genuine agent identity. This separates window-level co-occurrence, understood as correlational evidence, from co-instantiation at a single objective step, which constitutes a minimal synthesis condition necessary (though not sufficient) for identity constraints to jointly govern behaviour. We then instantiate Stack Theory\u2019s WeakSync and StrongSync postulates on grounded identity statements. This yields two persistence scores that can be computed from instrumented scaffold traces. We connect these scores to five operational identity metrics and map common scaffolds into an identity morphospace that exposes predictable tradeoffs. The result is a conservative toolkit for identity evaluation. It separates talking like a stable self from being organized like one.",

Recent findings lend support to the attention schema theory, with urgent implications for frontier AI. Attention self-modelling enables both cognitive control and improved coordination in artificial agents, providing evidence for a link between consciousness, intelligence, and social cooperation. The largest frontier models show emergent attentional observation and control, with the ability to shift their attention under internal noise. Given these results, we propose that researchers construct a test to measure the veracity of frontier model self-report based on attention modelling; a test for consciousness. We consider implementation and implications of such a test, including limitations of valence, phenomenology, and potential criticisms from a biological naturalist standpoint. Finally, we consider how to assess moral status to a system that implements certain aspects of consciousness.",

                  "Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active. We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families exhibit the phenomenon less frequently. We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models. These findings have dual implications: ESR could protect against adversarial manipulation but might also interfere with beneficial safety interventions that rely on activation steering. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is important for developing transparent and controllable AI systems.",

TCAS outputs theory-indexed credence bands rather than binary detection verdicts, supporting precautionary governance under uncertainty.

This creates a persistent epistemic failure mode in which narrative fluency is mistaken for system truth. We propose a geometry-first interface for interacting with non-linguistic dynamical systems that explicitly decouples state estimation from language generation. We introduce identity masks: structured conditioning objects that bind an inferred latent belief state, uncertainty, trajectory history, constraints, and interface coordinates to an interchangeable reasoning or control model. Identity masks prevent the interpreter from inventing state, instead requiring reasoning under explicit uncertainty and invariants. We complement this with the Coherence Circle, a low-dimensional geometric interface that anchors longitudinal interaction around an individual baseline attractor. We formalize coherence as an uncertainty-aware order parameter and outline generic operationalizations compatible with predictive processing and active inference. The resulting architecture supports closed-loop interaction while enabling falsifiable evaluation. We argue that these interface primitives are relevant to machine consciousness research because they transform abstract questions about integration, memory, and self-consistency into interventionally grounded, reproducible experiments, while remaining agnostic about phenomenal consciousness.",

Across fixed-parameter ablations, we operationalize Humphrey\u2019s qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice and find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive whereas affect coupling is stable even when scenic is less novel. In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation. In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution. Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants while leaving ReCoN unchanged.

We characterize the constraints on temporal translation\u2014causal, bounded, continuous, locally interpretable\u2014and show they admit essentially one solution class among linear, time-invariant, finite-state summaries: exponentially decaying measurements at geometrically spaced timescales. When spaced by the golden ratio to maximize incommensurability, this decomposition provides a minimal temporal language in which the past is present and credit assignment becomes tractable. We instantiate this in Local Predictive Field Networks, demonstrating continuous adaptation without catastrophic forgetting, under fixed resources, with no replay and no sequence storage. The architecture satisfies a requirement that theories of consciousness increasingly emphasize: temporal integration must be intrinsic to the system\u2019s state, not externalized as retrievable data. A system with translated time is its history; it does not merely have access to it. The failure of continual learning is not a failure of learning rules. It is a failure to give them a language for time.",

                  "Conventional reinforcement learning often yields high performing but opaque agents that lack inspectable internal structure for deliberation. We present Hector, a cognitive architecture based on Request-Confirmation Networks (ReCoN), designed to study how hierarchical subgoals and planning horizons can emerge from self-organizing symbolic structures. Using chess endgames as a controlled symbolic microcosm, we show that a unified topology containing both KPK (king+pawn vs. king) and KQK (king+queen vs. king) subgraphs shifts control from promotion to checkmate with one-move latency, with the transition observable in internal activations. On a KPK curriculum, Hector achieves a 97.0% win rate, while PPO baselines reach 26.3% (50k timesteps) and 35.9% (200k timesteps). We argue that autonomous strategic handover is a minimal operational requirement for deliberative agency: the ability to maintain, suspend, and reallocate control across competing internal models based on global context rather than local reward signals. While we make no claims about phenomenal consciousness, Hector provides a concrete, inspectable mechanism for global control, working memory, and top-down/bottom-up integration\u2014properties central to multiple leading theories of consciousness.",

We present MIRROR, a cognitive architecture that implements these features in large language models and tests whether they produce the functional behaviors these theories predict. MIRROR separates immediate response generation from asynchronous deliberative processing through two components: an Inner Monologue Manager that generates parallel cognitive threads (tracking goals, reasoning, and memory simultaneously), and a Cognitive Controller that synthesizes these threads into a bounded first-person narrative. Critically, this narrative is not accumulated but reconstructed each turn\u2014mirroring the reconstructive nature of human episodic memory, where the self-model is continuously rebuilt rather than retrieved. We evaluated MIRROR on multi-turn dialogue requiring retention of personal safety constraints amid competing social demands. MIRROR-augmented models achieve 21% average improvement over baselines, with the key finding being not the magnitude but the pattern: performance gains concentrate in scenarios requiring integration of temporally distant information under social pressure, precisely where access consciousness theories predict global availability provides advantage. We do not claim MIRROR is conscious; we claim it provides a testbed where theoretical predictions can be tested and examined.",

                  "High-rapport conversational systems can elicit attachment, over-trust, and implicit delegation while providing no stable evidence of accountable agency. This creates a governance failure mode in which persuasive fluency becomes a decision surface, yet liability remains fully human when harm occurs. We propose the consequence boundary, a deployable delegation threshold that does not depend on consciousness attribution. Crossing the boundary requires three properties: persistent identity (a stable accountable unit across reset surfaces), internal tension (constraint stability under adversarial temptation across framings and reinstantiation), and internalized consequence (a non-erasable binding consequence under a declared operator threat model). We provide the CB-3 Gate, a boxed evaluation procedure that specifies inputs, steps, pass and fail criteria, stop-ship rules, outputs, and a falsifier. We ground the framework in observed deployment patterns including liability snapback in the Air Canada chatbot case, verification collapse in Mata v. Avianca, and reliance proxies in action paths via Copilot-style suggestion acceptance. Below the consequence boundary, systems may advise, but they may not hold irreversible authority without human-held keys.",

We argue that \u0394 should be treated as a first-class design object: formally represented, empirically tested, and architecturally implemented through explicit adjudication. We propose (i) a compact taxonomy of \u0394 (conceptual, proxy/measurement, contextual, epistemic, normative), (ii) a benchmark-style \u0394-audit distinguishing output behavior from process and architectural evidence, and (iii) a \u0394-first constitution stack grounded in existing alignment techniques. We argue that explicit \u0394-adjudication is not a claim of consciousness, but is diagnostically relevant to theories emphasizing integration, global availability/broadcast, and metacognitive access. This makes \u0394-adjudication a practical nexus for integrated progress across theory, measurement/attribution, implementation constraints, and normative governance in machine consciousness research.",

Our five-dimensional structure\u2014phenomenal consciousness, affective valence, metacognitive awareness, self-narrative, and agency\u2014captures welfare-relevant aspects that can dissociate in AI systems, with three evidence thresholds per dimension triggering progressively stronger obligations. Two complementary aggregation approaches apply: developmental-theoretic when architectural transparency permits, evidence-aggregative for black-box systems. The framework addresses AI-specific challenges including the gaming problem. Application to current LLMs suggests they do not reach significant protection thresholds, though agentic extensions warrant scrutiny.

                abstract:
                  "Asking which theories of consciousness apply to artificial systems requires asking what kinds of unity different forms of consciousness exhibit. Many contemporary theories treat consciousness as a byproduct of information integration, global availability, or self-representation. Such approaches may plausibly apply to artificial systems insofar as they model lower-order forms of awareness. However, philosophical traditions descending from Kant and phenomenology insist that the forms of consciousness characteristic of agents like us are not exhausted by experiential awareness or representational integration, but involve a structured relation of a self to itself as a rational and practical agent. This paper distinguishes pre-reflective self-awareness from reflective self-consciousness. Pre-reflective self-awareness is the minimal form of self-involvement present in experience as such: the fact that experiences are given as mine rather than yours. Reflective self-consciousness, by contrast, is a practical and normative agential self-relation. Self-conscious agents are able to actively \u201cmake up\u201d their minds, changing their beliefs, intentions, or desires in light of their awareness of what is true and ethically good. The upshot for artificial consciousness is not a skeptical dismissal but a constructive contribution to the design and assessment of possible mechanisms of consciousness and self-consciousness in artificial systems.",

A theory that accounts for illusions reduces the risk of producing false positives\u2014theories that explain merely the appearance of consciousness rather than genuine consciousness.

Rather than asking \u201cIs this system conscious?\u201d as if consciousness were a single, all-or-nothing property, we should be developing more granular frameworks that can capture the diverse ways in which systems (biological and artificial) process information, model themselves and their environments, and exhibit behaviors associated with awareness.
